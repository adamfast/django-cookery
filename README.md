# django-cookery: A simple recipe editor and menu planner using Django

## Getting started

1. Clone this repository
2. `virtualenv env`
3. Activate your virtualenv (`source env/bin/activate` or
`env\Scripts\activate` on Windows)
4. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. `cd cookery`
6. `python manage.py migrate`

## Target environment

This is built to support Python 3.5 only, although compatibility with older
versions is likely to happen (but accidentally so only).

## Inspiration

This project came about largely as an inspiration from my wife, who was tired
of doing things manually but didn't want to buy an overblown and overcomplicated
Windows app, locking us into a vendor ecosystem yet again.
